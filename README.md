### Hey there!
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying computer science dreaming of landing a job in silicon valley as a fulltime developer.

âœ¨ I have been really interested in programming since I was about 9 years old and have always dreamed of being a software developer.

ðŸ¥º My apologise for the empty repository list, a lot of my work I do not feel comfortable with making public _as of yet_.
